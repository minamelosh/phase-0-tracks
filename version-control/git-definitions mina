# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?

Version control is a way to manage changes to documents and code in a way that maintains the original copy and saving the new aspects in another version.  Version control is useful because allows many people to work on the same thing while also keeping the original intact so you can revert back to compare work or work on different versions.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a way I can work on my own copy of a project without affecting the original.  It is a good way for one person to work, and make changes in way that others can review their work before adding their changes to the original.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is saving my changes to my branch, and a good commit message is specific and describes what I did.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when your branch and the branch you want to merge have differences - meaning you have commits in your branch that are not in the other branch and vice versa.
