<!--
What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
	Semantic tags provide meaning to the HTML sections and make the page more 	readable.  They are a way to organize your code in a universal way that both humans 	and computer can more easily understand since it is more universal than creating 	your own tags.  I think the header, nav, and section tags will be the most useful when 	organizing a webpage.

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
	For HTML the browser displays the items in order of how they appear in the coding, 	CSS can give the browser instructions to reorder items.
  
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy
snippets at a later date?
	I realized how smart Sublime and Atom are!! I am really excited about snippets and 	do plan to creat and use them in the future.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
	For this challenge it took a while for me and my partner to understand the use of 	semantic elements and what exactly their purpose was.  But I am glad that we both 	expressed this and so we got to talk a lot and research the tags until we both felt 	comfortable with their uses and purposes.  Our guide was also awesome!  He used 	analogies to help really see how they work, why they're useful and how we can use 	them in the future.
